##TuneTube allows you to search through Vevo's rich catalog of musical content with the ability to access each song result in a single browser. On youtube you would have to dig through multiple other results that have your search keyword in their title. But on this site it is only looking for the song or artist you wish to find. The app is made to be used on phone, tablet, and desktop. The responsive design amkes it fit to each and every screen size that you are using at the time.
